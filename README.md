# JS-EPG
Javascript version of the Euclidean Pattern Generator

## Introduction
JS-EPG is a Javascript version of the Euclidean Pattern Generator, a Java application I made several years ago and which can be found [in its repository](https://github.com/WouterHisschemoller/Euclidean-Pattern-Generator) here on GitHub.

This Javascript app generates rhythms that can be used to create music. The rhythms are generated by a mathematical formula that is based on the Euclidean Algorithm, and became therefore known as [Euclidean rhythms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_rhythm).

JS-EPG outputs the rhythms as MIDI messages, so to actually hear any sounds you have to choose a MIDI output in the app that is connected to a MIDI equipped sound generator. That can be software like Ableton Live, an iPad app, or a hardware drum machine, synthesizer or sampler.

JS-EPG uses the Javascript [Web MIDI API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi/) to send MIDI messages. Only a few browsers support Web MIDI at the moment. [Check CanIUse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=web%20midi%20api) for the current browser support.

## Note
This app is a project in progress, so all of the above might not yet work at all.
