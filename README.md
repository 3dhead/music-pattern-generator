# JS-EPG
Javascript version of the Euclidean Pattern Generator

## Introduction
This is an application to create rhythm patterns that can be used in music. It doesn't produce any sounds by itself, but sends MIDI messages for other applications to receive. These applications are typically music programs like Ableton Live, Cubase or FL Studio. But MIDI messages can also be sent to external hardware instruments like drum machines, samplers or synthesizers. 

The application creates a specific type of patterns, known as Euclidean rhythms. These are generated by a mathematical algorithm and often resemble African and South-American traditional drum and percussion patterns. The application makes it easy to create polyrhythms, where patterns of different length play together to create interesting slowly evolving rhythms.

A desktop application can be downloaded for Windows, Mac and Linux, and it can be used as an online app that runs in the browser as well (Chrome and Chromium only at the moment). It is written in Javascript and uses the Electron framework to create the desktop versions.

## Euclidean rhythms
Euclidean rhythms are generated with a simple mathematical formula. It distributes an amount of pulses as evenly as possible over a period of time, where time is divided in equal parts. So, say you have four notes to divide over a sequence of sixteen steps, the result would be the following pattern:

``x . . . x . . . x . . . x . . .``

The notes are spread as evenly as possible over the length of time: Each note is followed by three silent rests. Because there are four notes on sixteen steps the division is easy: 16 / 4 = 4. One note every four steps. Ab basic techno or house kick pattern.

The results get more interesting if the numbers can't be so cleanly divided. Then the patterns get irregular. If we take five notes over sixteen steps, the pattern will look like this:

``x . . . x . . x . . x . . x . .``

It’s these irregular patterns that create the best rhythms. Especially when several patterns are combined.

## Introduction (old)

JS-EPG is a Javascript version of the Euclidean Pattern Generator, a Java application I made several years ago. It has [its own repository](https://github.com/WouterHisschemoller/Euclidean-Pattern-Generator) here on GitHub.

This Javascript app generates rhythms that can be used to create music. The rhythms are generated by a mathematical formula that is based on the Euclidean Algorithm. These rhythms therefore became known as [Euclidean rhythms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_rhythm).

JS-EPG outputs the rhythms as MIDI messages, so to actually hear any sounds you have to choose a MIDI output in the app that is connected to a MIDI equipped sound generator. That generator can be a software DAW like Ableton Live or a hardware drum machine, synthesizer or sampler.

JS-EPG uses the Javascript [Web MIDI API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi/) to send MIDI messages. Only a few browsers support Web MIDI at the moment. [Check CanIUse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=web%20midi%20api) for the current browser support.

## Usage
To run the app simply open index.html in a web browser. There are no dependencies on external online files and it doesn't need a server, so it can be used offline.

To add a rhythm pattern doubleclick anywhere on the canvas area and a pattern graphic will appear. A default new pattern has 16 steps and plays four notes, effectively a note on each beat as in a standard house or techno four-to-the-floor kick drum pattern.

There are a few keyboard shortcuts:

| Key       | Action                  |
| ---       | ---                     |
| Space     | Toggle start / stop     |
| Backspace | Delete selected pattern |

## Saving and exporting projects

Projects can be exported as a file to the local file system (the desktop for instance) by simply clicking the Export button (disk icon) in the header bar. This will present you with the computer's regular file save dialog.

A regular 'save' option to automatically overwrite the current project file doesn't exist. This is because Javascript doesn't have this kind of direct access to the computer's file system.

## Importing projects

Project files can be imported by simply clicking the Import button (open folder icon) in the header bar. This will present you with the computer's regular file save open dialog.

## Autosave

All settings are saved however to the browser's LocalStorage when the page unloads, and restored from LocalStorage when the page is loaded again. So you can shut down your browser and start it up the next day, and your settings and preferences will be restored. 

## Note
This app is a project in progress, so all of the above might not yet work at all.
